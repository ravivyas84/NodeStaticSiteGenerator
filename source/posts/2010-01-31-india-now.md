The mood in India now oozes positivity and optimism, a hope of better tomorrow can be seen on everyone&#8217;s faces and a better today can be seen all around. Whether its big things like mass transit starting up everywhere or small things like the garbage collector lady at my apartments and the Bhelpuri walla on the street carrying a cell phone. In fact if you were watch Discovery&#8217;s show &#8220;Paul Merton in India&#8221; they interview a guy who used to live on the platform in CST Mumbai now has a 1BR house a bed , a bed that does not have a mattress , but in the corner of the room sits an icon of the modern world , the computer. Which to me was the biggest WOW moment in the past 2 years.
