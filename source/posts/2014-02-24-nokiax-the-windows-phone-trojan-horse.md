The NokiaX is probably Nokia's attempt to build a #WindowsPhone trojan horse for the #Android ecosystem. Like Amazon, Nokia have swapped out Google services for a combination of their own and Microsoft services. 

The devices pull in elements from Nokia's Asha series and Microsoft WindowsPhone ecosystem.

If Microsoft can start matching each of the Google Services this might be a Good play as the devices have be prices very well starting at €89 and going up to €109 ( ~ INR 9000 or $ 150)﻿
