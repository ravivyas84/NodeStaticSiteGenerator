This is a joke about Management vs IT , I take no credit for it , I heard it for the first time on a podcast from IT Conversations.<!--more-->

A man is in a hot air balloon and is lost , he find a person below and asks :

&#8220;Excuse me, can you help me? I promised a friend I would meet him an hour ago , I am lost and I don&#8217;t know where I am.&#8221;

The man below replied, &#8220;You are in a hot air balloon hovering approx 30 feet above the ground. on the edge of a field.&#8221;

&#8220;You must be in IT&#8221; said the balloonist.

&#8220;I am&#8221; replied the man, &#8220;how did you know?&#8221;

&#8220;Well&#8221; answered the balloonist, &#8220;everything you told me is technically correct, but I have no idea what to make of your information, and the fact is I am still lost. Frankly, you&#8217;ve not been much help far&#8221;

The man below responded, &#8220;You must be management&#8221;

&#8220;I am&#8221; replied the balloonist &#8220;but how did you know?&#8221;

&#8220;Well&#8221; said the man &#8220;you don&#8217;t know where you are or where you are going. You made a promise which you have no idea how to keep, and you expect me to solve your problem. You are in exactly the same position now that you were in before we met, but now, somehow, it&#8217;s my fault.&#8221;
