How many times do you have 1 unread email in Gmail and you cant seem to find it? Wish there was easy way to do it? This post will explain 3 quick ways to find all those unread emails.

  1. Gmail has a reserved label called unread , so you can just search for _label:unread_ to display all your unread emails.
  2. Dont want to type that? Just go to <https://mail.google.com/mail/u/0/?shva=1#search/label%3Aunread> which will go to the same page.
  3. Now if you are as lazy as me and have you booksmarks bar hidden in Chrome , you can use a Chrome app to directly jump to the link above.  You can download the extension <a href="http://www.ravivyas.com/files/unread.crx" target="_blank">here</a> . Right click the link and download it . Directly installing it will give an error. If you wish you can also use an archive manager to change the logo or change the url to go to another Gmail label.
