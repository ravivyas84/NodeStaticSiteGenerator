If my math is correct nearly 10% of the smartphones worldwide can now run flash, and that number is only going to rise. How?

Android now owns 25% of the market share as stated by recent Gartner reports . Within Android, 36% of the phones run 2.2 which can run Adobe flash and Adobe Air. As Android makes rises to market dominance at #1 as reported by the various analysts Adobe Flash is only going to get more ubiquitous and to be frank not &#8220;die&#8221;. The death of Flash is largely exaggerated. Its not easy to just get rid of something that has been dominant for a decade.

Even with HTML 5 coming into the picture as a worthy competitor it is far from being a standard. The web innovates too quickly and browser companies try to push anything that can give them an edge into the standards. Even now there are a bunch of things only Chrome can run and vice-versa for other browsers. Now this is great of the end consumer as it pushes innovations but a possible hassle for developers who need to make their app run on every browser. Flash takes all these issues out for both developers and consumers , consumers can use any browser to consume content and developers can target all consumers while Adobe worries about compatibility and more importantly security ( which it is trying to address using sand-boxing).
