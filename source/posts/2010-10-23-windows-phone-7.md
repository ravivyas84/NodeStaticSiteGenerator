Microsoft was come late to a fight but this time around have brought guns to a gun fight. <!--more-->Windows Phone 7 looks great in all the videos I have seen , also the interface is very different from the iPhone and the Android and as people say has a more OS centric design to it. But one of the biggest issues with it is even after being late to this fight they decided to skip on features which are now standard on other platforms. No multitasking , no copy paste ( which will be fixed in the next release), incomplete access to the phone&#8217;s camera ( http://bit.ly/cp4zCh ) are some of the features I have heard about. Come on Microsoft you cant come late to a gunfight and forget ammunition too.
