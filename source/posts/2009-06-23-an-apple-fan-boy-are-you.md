    Well by the looks of it the most domninant OS is not going down easily.... not if Cullen Dudas has his way. He has demontrated what I belive is the best UI I have ever seen, and from the looks of it it would be touch friendly too. Unless Microsoft have something better I hope Mr. Cullen Dudas soon joins the Windows UI team. He also has a white paper which you may read if you like.
